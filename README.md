# CSSkinScrapper
This is a web scrapper which gets the average prices of a CSGO skin. The skins are defined by the user in the console. The program creates an overview in an excel sheet, with win/loose calculations and the subtraction of the steam market fee. 

## Instructions
Download the executable of the latest release and put it in it's own directory, because the program will create a new excel sheet in its own path. Further information are provided by the tutorial in the console. It also creates a settings.json which you can change. The values are pretty much self explanatory and if you don't know what a setting does, don't change it ;).

## Note:
The project is finished except for checking other markets. Feel free to branch the project for yourself and add features you need. Also feel free to create Pull Requests to merge your new features, I will see and review them. You can also create new issues if you find one, but it might take a while till they get fixed, because this is how far this project gets for now. I might get back to it in the future.
